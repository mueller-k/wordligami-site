# Wordligami

Wordligami is the art of building Wordles that have never happend in group chat history.

Based on the popular NFL Scorigami built by Jon Bois.

Each Wordle result you post to the "Banal" group chat in GroupMe will be thrown to the Wordligami processor in AWS. There, a determination will be made if that Wordle board is a unique, never-before-seen combo or just a boring ol' repeat. Instant results are posted to the Wordligami group chat!

Think you're special? Find out with Wordligami!
