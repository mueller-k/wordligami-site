# Wordligami

Wordligami is the art of building Wordles that have never happend in group chat history.

Based on the popular [NFL Scorigami](https://nflscorigami.com/) built by [Jon Bois](https://twitter.com/jon_bois).

Each Wordle result you post to the "Banal" group chat in GroupMe will be thrown to the Wordligami processor in AWS. There, a determination will be made if that Wordle board is a unique, never-before-seen combo or just a boring ol' repeat. Instant results are posted to the Wordligami group chat!

Think your Wordle is special? Find out with Wordligami!

## What is a unique Wordle?

Consider the following group chat history: 

![group chat message](https://ucarecdn.com/96d8db41-223f-4dba-bb20-6a60b9dad0e7/-/preview/500x500/-/quality/smart_retina/-/format/auto/)

If your Wordle board for the next day looks like this:

Wordle 857 3/6*

â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨  
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨  
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©  

That is NOT a Wordligami. Wah Wah. Connie's submission for Wordle 856 is an identical board.


BUT, if your Wordle board looks like this:

Wordle 856 4/6*

â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨  
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ¨  
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨  
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©  

Hot diggity dog! That's a Wordligami! Submit it and claim your glory!

## What are the odds I have a unique Wordle?

The above is just a narrow example of Wordligami. In reality, Wordligami will be be checking your submission against all the thousands (yeah, thousands!) of Wordle boards that have already been submitted in the Banal group chat.

So what are the odds of your next Wordle being unique? Only one way to find out!
