# Wordligami

Wordligami is the art of building Wordles that have never happend in group chat history.

Based on the popular [NFL Scorigami](https://nflscorigami.com/) built by [Jon Bois](https://twitter.com/jon_bois).

Each Wordle result you post to the "Banal" group chat in GroupMe will be thrown to the Wordligami processor in AWS. There, a determination will be made if that Wordle board is a unique, never-before-seen combo or just a boring ol' repeat. Instant results are posted to the Wordligami group chat!

Think your Wordle is special? Find out with Wordligami!

## What is a unique Wordle?

Consider the following group chat history: 

![group chat message](https://ucarecdn.com/96d8db41-223f-4dba-bb20-6a60b9dad0e7/-/preview/500x500/-/quality/smart_retina/-/format/auto/-/border_radius/25/)

If your Wordle board for the next day looks like this:

Wordle 857 3/6*

â¬œðŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œðŸŸ¨  
â¬œðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ¨  
ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©  

That is NOT a Wordligami. Wah Wah. Connie's submission for Wordle 856 is an identical board.


BUT, if your Wordle board looks like this:

Wordle 856 4/6*

â¬œðŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œðŸŸ¨  
â¬œðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ©â¬œðŸŸ¨  
â¬œðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ¨  
ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©  

Hot diggity dog! That's a Wordligami! Submit it and claim your glory!

## What are the odds I have a unique Wordle?

The above is just a narrow example of Wordligami. In reality, Wordligami will be checking your submission against all the thousands (yeah, thousands!) of Wordle boards that have already been submitted in the Banal group chat.

But what are the odds of your next Wordle being unique? I got a C- in Probability and Statistics in college, but luckily someone smarter than me has already figured the hard part out.

See this [stack exchange post](https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/114469/how-many-wordle-images-are-there) asking how many possible Wordle boards there are. The resulting answer is a whopping 177,961,648,104,787 boards. However, in Wordligami, we don't count boards that don't result in a correct guess. Because of that, we can elimiate a massive 177,210,755,074,809 possibilities, slimming our upper bound to just a measly 750,893,029,978 boards. There are some caveats with this limit. It allows Wordle submissions not played on "Hard" mode, which forces positive information to be reused on subsequent guesses. Additionally, this universe of possible boards is not constrained by any dictionary. It's allowing for any combo of 26 letters. But even then, we'll assume it's close enough for our purposes.

As of 11/15/2023, 3,278 Wordligami's have already been found.

That leaves just **750,893,026,700** possibilities remaining! I'm not typically a gambling man, but I like those odds.
